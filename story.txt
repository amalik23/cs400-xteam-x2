Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ogre named Shrek whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad. Determined to save their home -- not to mention his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue Princess Fiona to be Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small compared to her deep, dark secret. (Spoiler Alert: She's an ogre).

You would think that Shrek would proceed to save the princess. If you though that, you would be wrong. Instead, Shrek decided to hang out with his pal, Donkey. Donkey has always been a fan of pancakes. Shrek and Donkey enjoyed the delicacies produced in front of them. Donkey shouts, "that was delicious"

Shrek has rescued Princess Fiona,
 got married, and now is time to meet the parents.
 Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey set off to Far, Far Away to meet Fiona's
 mother and father. But not everyone is happy.
 Shrek and the King find it hard to get along,
 and there's tension in the marriage. It's not
 just the family who are unhappy.
 Prince Charming returns from a failed attempt at rescuing Fiona,
 and works alongside his mother,
 the Fairy Godmother, to try and find a way to get Shrek away from Fiona. 

Shrek realizes he isn't really happy with his life, and ghosts Fiona, Donkey, and the whole crew.  He sells his home, liquidates his stock, and sets off on a pilgramige to China to find himself.  Shrek doesn't know what he's gotten himself into, and The Great Wall looms over him and his questionable future.
